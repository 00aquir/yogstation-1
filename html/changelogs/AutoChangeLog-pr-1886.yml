  - rscadd: "Changeling chemical glands have increased their viability, vastly improving the utility of changeling stings. In particular, Nanotrasen crews should be aware that 'mute sting' now injects mute toxin, and the 'transform sting' no longer damages changeling genomes."
  - rscadd: "Changelings have successfully fought-off the NT retrovirus bioweapon that forced them to change their single-target hallucination stings into mass-ending plagues of hallucinations, likely because NT realized this was a horrible idea, and the hallucination sting is now a single-target, low cost sting once again."
