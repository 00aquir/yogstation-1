  - tweak: "Xenofacility ruin has had some big additions, rooms have been moved around, the power grid is now powered by Pacmans instead of a backup SMES meaning scientists will have to occassionally check up on the pacmans every 20-30 minutes. The Flavor text has been dumbed down for the Scientists and new ways to interact with xenomorphs have been introduced and hinted to, more weapons added and weapons are now stored in one big area, every scientist gets a hardsuit now and due to a recent breakthrough in xenomorph communication 50 units of cardboard have been provided. There's a few other stuff as-well, scientists will have to explore the facility and get accustomed to the new stuff they have available to them."

  - bugfix: "Watcher Spiral has less watchers and the chest no-longer gets pushed into lava"
