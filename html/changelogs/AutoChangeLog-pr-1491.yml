  - bugfix: "Fixed the lag. Cause of lag, IT'S THE GOD DAMN ACTION ICONS. Now, name off a few things you'd expect to cause lag: Atmos, large amounts of space carp, maybe having to process breathing and shit, maybe a loose singularity, but no. It's just action icons being ridiculously inefficient as fuck for literally no reason. This fix basically makes them not update their overlays every single tick."
