  - rscadd: "Sterilizine now reduces probability of step failure if you apply it after starting surgery. Useful while operating in less-than-perfect conditions. This also increases surgery speed. NanoMeds have 1 bottle of this (100u)."
  - rscadd: "Potent alcohol can be used as replacement for sterilizine."
  - rscadd: "Usage Instructions : 1. START THE SURGERY FIRST (using drapes); 2. Apply sterilizing agent."
  - rscadd: "Slime Core Removal surgery now works. You'll need drapes to initiate the procedure...and a dead slime, obviously."
